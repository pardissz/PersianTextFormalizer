PersianTextFormalizer
Welcome to the PersianTextFormalizer repository! This project is dedicated to formalizing Persian text using a fine-tuned model based on the T5 transformer.

Model Description
The model in this repository has been specifically fine-tuned to convert informal Persian text into a more formal style. It leverages the power of the persian-t5-formality-transfer pretrained model and has been trained on the Mohavere Dataset. This dataset was developed by Takalli Vahideh, Kalantari Fateme, and Shamsfard Mehrnoush in their 2022 study, “Developing an Informal-Formal Persian Corpus”.

Usage
To use this model, simply provide your informal Persian text as input. The model will then generate a formalized version of your text.

Stay tuned for more updates and improvements to the model. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
